            ABOUT ME
          </h1>
          <p>Hi! I am Victoria, an experience designer, ocean lover and turtle lover. I am deeply passionate about environmental sustainability, especially marine conservation. I created this website as a passion project to raise awareness about plastic pollution, highlight the simple steps that we can take as individuals to do our part and collate resources for those who are interested to read up more on the subject. I first know of this plastic pollution problem after coming across a video of a plastic straw being stuck deep inside a nostril of a sea turtle.  It really hurt me to see the poor, innocent turtle in such agony and it sickened me to the core. </p>
          <p>I believe that most of us would have been exposed to the issue of global warming and ocean pollution during our geography or science classes in schools, or occasionally saw news articles about these topics. However, a lot of people around me who live in abundance simply do not care about the environment and the impact of their actions on the environment. A lot of us take the benefit of oceans for granted and prioritize convenience over sustainability. The collective impact has led to ocean to its fragile health now. I understand that I come from a position of privilege, to be able to care about these issues (compared to those who wake up everyday worrying about whether they have enough food for today etc.), I just want to implore those who can, to help save the oceans. Don't ever belittle the contribution of your effort. Collectively, we can make a difference. Let's do our part to remedy/ reverse this situation before it's too late.
