# Plastic Pollution

Plastic Pollution is my submission for Project 0 of the course CS50W Web Programming with Python and JavaScript, offered by Harvard University.
It is a website that aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution and the current state of efforts to combat this issue; highlight the simple steps that we can take as individuals to do our part and collate resources for those who are interested to read up more on the subject. All requirements stipulated were fulfilled.


## What's in each file
* whatshappening.html: Home page with some statistics of plastic pollution
* whatsdone.html: 2nd page that shows what countries and companies have done with relevance to reducing their plastic pollution.
* whatcanido.html: 3rd page with practical ideas on what an individual can do
* about.html: 4th and final page about the author and this website
* style.scss: the scss stylesheet
* style.css: the stylesheet generated after running the command `sass style.scss style.css` in terminal
